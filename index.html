        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h4>Teacher turned Developer</h4>
        <p>From Legos and painting to designing the coolest HTML for my Myspace page in highschool, 
            I've always been drawn to building and creating. I attended CSU Chico and became a teacher 
            so that I could share my love of learning with the world. 
            <br>
            As a teacher, I worked in "Professional Learning Communities" where we analyzed student data to direct our instruction 
            in collaborative teams. I managed a classroom of students, parent volunteers and classroom aides. 
            During the pandemic when teaching went remote, I began learning new software so quickly and 
            efficiently that I was soon leading professional development on it for the other teachers on my 
            campus. This got me thinking, what if I pursued my love of technology and transitioned to tech?
            <br>
            After months of exploring coding for fun in my free time, I am now enrolled in a full-stack 
            coding bootcamp learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Django, React and more. So far I've 
            created multiple browser games and full stack web applications. I can't wait to tackle more projects.
